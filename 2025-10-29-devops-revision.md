## 🔐 Basics of Security Testing

* **SAST** → Analyzes source code before execution
* **DAST** → Tests the application while it is running
* **SCA** → Scans external/third-party dependencies
* Helps detect security issues at an early stage

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow (Easy Breakdown)

1. Fetch code from repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Perform code quality checks (linting)
4. Build the application
5. Execute tests
6. Run security scans
7. Generate artifacts (Docker image/build files)
8. Deploy to staging or production

* Ensures fast and reliable deployments

## 🔄 DevOps Lifecycle (Flow to Remember)

Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Repeat

* This cycle runs continuously

---

## 📌 Core DevOps Concepts

* Strong collaboration between teams
* Automation of repetitive tasks
* Continuous integration and delivery
* Monitoring and performance measurement
* Knowledge sharing across teams
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* Continuous feedback and improvement
